# Interval Timer

This is a sleak and powerful, yet simple interval timer. You can create your own set of timers for a full routine. Easy repeats and inserting breaks. Name each part of the interval to keep yourself on track. Timers can be saved in your browser's local storage or you can bookmark the timer's URL and come back to it later.
